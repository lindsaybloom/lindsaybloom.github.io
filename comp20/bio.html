             I was born and raised in Toronto, Canda where I developed and indulged my passion for sports (including hockey, of course) and technology. Today, you are likely to find me at the gym or Halligan Hall (Tufts Computer Science building). I was a member of the Tufts Varsity Women's Basketball Team in 2016 and competed in a <a href='https://tuftsdaily.com/sports/2016/04/05/139379/' target='_blank'>NCAA National Championship Game</a>. When I'm not at the gym or Halligan, I could be exploring the Boston food scene and running <a href='http://www.spoonuniversity.com/chapter/tufts' target='_blank'>Spoon University Tufts</a> or listening to my favorite podcasts. 
             <br><br> As a sophomore at Tufts University, I am an aspiring Software Engineer with an interest in front end and full stack. I love to learn about new technologies and am always willing to take on a new project. I'm looking to gain experience in the tech world and learn soak up as much knowledge as possible!
